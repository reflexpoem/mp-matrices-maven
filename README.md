Overview:
In this project, I will build a two-dimensional array in Java. I will write code to create and change the matrix by adding, deleting, and modifying rows and columns. I’ll also write tests to check that my matrix works properly. There are different ways to make the matrix, and I can choose the method I’m most comfortable with.
